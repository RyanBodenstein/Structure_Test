# Structure_Test
Testing how to make the file structure work 

Been a while since I did this. Please fork, edit, and make a pull request, and I can see if it's working.


Note added from Todd :)

Thanks Todd, just testing again. Made a "develop" branch that people can work from, then (hopefully) make a pull request to the main branch that has to be approved. That way, there's oversight. Let's see if I did it right.
